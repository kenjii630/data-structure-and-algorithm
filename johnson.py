# Used to find all pair the shortest path in a graph.
    # and find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in an edge weighted directed graph.
# O (V2 log ? V+VE ) time
# It's used both Dijkstra's and bellman ford in case for the negatively weighted graphs.
# Used Floyd warshall though Johnson is much more efficient in terms of time complexity more than the floyd
