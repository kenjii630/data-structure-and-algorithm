O is the order of growth
n is the length of the input

    . Constant time o(1)
        - if / else condition
    . Linear time o(n)
        - for loop
    . Logarithmic time o(log n)
    . Quadratic time o(n^2)
        - nestest for loop
    . cubic time o(n^3)
    . Factorial time o(n!)
    . Quasilinear Time O(n log n)
