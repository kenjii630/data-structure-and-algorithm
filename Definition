Data structure:
    primitive and non-primitive
        primitives:
            # int
            # string
            # boolean
            # float
        non-primitive:
            linear and non-linear
                linear:
                    static and dynamic
                        static:
                            * array
                        dynamic:
                            * linked list
                            * queue
                            * stack

                non-linear:
                    * graph (cyclic)
                    * tree  (acyclic)
